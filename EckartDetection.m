%{ 
    Perform energy detection with Eckart-filtered signals and return the
    detection performance stats, for a signal within white noise and one in
    non-white noise.
    Input: 
        SigWhiteNoise (num[]): received signal within white noise
        SigNW (num[]): received signal within non-white noise
        PresentW (bool[]): flags presence (1) or absence (0) of signal in
            white noise
        PresentNW (bool[]): flags presence (1) or absence (0) of signal in
            non-white noise
        Pfas (num[], 0<=num(i)<=1): sorted probabilities of false alarm
        Sig (num[]): transmitted signal
    Output: 
        PdsWhite (num[], 0<=num(i)<=1): resulting probabilities of
            detection for signal within white noise
        PdsNW (num[], 0<=num(i)<=1): resulting probabilities of detection
            for signal within non-white noise
